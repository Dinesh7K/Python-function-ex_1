#1. John would like to create a function to check whether given number is 
positive or negative or neutral. Help him to write an independent function 
and pass different inputs to the function and check its behaviour.

def fun(n):
    
    if(n>=0):
        print("POSITIVE")
    elif(n==0):
        print("NEUTRAL")
    else:
        print("NEGATIVE")
result1=fun(5)
result2=fun(-3)
result3=fun(0)
print(result1,result2,result3)
